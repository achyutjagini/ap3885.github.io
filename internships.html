1. OSRAM Opto Semiconductors:<br>
March - July 2019, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors,4 Leibnizstr., 93055 Regensburg, Germany <br>
I did my final semester undergraduate internship at OSRAM Opto Semiconductors. In my role there, I implemented a high current laser testing system with better performance against noise
by using signal processing techniques and thereby reduced overall testing time.

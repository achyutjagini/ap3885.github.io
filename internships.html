1. OSRAM Opto Semiconductors:<br>
March - July 2018, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors,4 Leibnizstr., 93055 Regensburg, Germany <br>
I did my final semester undergraduate internship at OSRAM Opto Semiconductors. In my role there, I implemented a high current laser testing system with better performance against noise
by using signal processing techniques and thereby reduced overall testing time.

In the summer of 2017, I interned at OSRAM OS in California working to improve infrared dectecting sensors for various client projects. I was also in charge of characterizing heart-rate 
monitoring diodes using Labview.

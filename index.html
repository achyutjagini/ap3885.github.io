Hello! I am a final year Electrical Engineering graduate from Columbia University. . My current focus areas and research interests are in Machine
Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision Perception and reasoning. I am also interested in the GPU/embedded deployment of Learning algorithms. 
In my free time (and if not, i try to make time for) soccer! I'm an avid follower and have spent my childhood playing and competing till the national level. 
I also love exploring new places and cuisines and rock concerts!
